### Hoi

I'm Koen, known online mostly as ["braver"](https://www.vertalen.nu/vertaal?vertaal=koen&van=nl&naar=en) (because I'm more brave online than in reality 😉).

🏢 I currently work at [CultureSuite](https://www.culturesuite.co) on the [Peppered platform](https://www.peppered.com).  
👨‍💻 I built [ProgrammingFonts](https://www.programmingfonts.org), the interactive list of _all the programming fonts_...  
💻 ... as well as the [package](https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel) [index](https://packagecontrol.io) for Sublime Text  
⌨️ ... and have created packages like [SideBarTools](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SideBarTools), [FileIcons](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/FileIcons), and [ColorHints](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ColorHints), and made major contributions to [Sass/SCSS](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Sass), [Less](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Less), [SublimeLinter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter) ..[too many](https://packagecontrol.io/search/braver) to name them all.
